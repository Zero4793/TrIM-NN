The recreaction/improvement of my old AI-NN project in processing now ported to pygame.
Aim to remake evolution/boid sim and maybe others.
Aim to implement my unique TrIM NN which i have seen nowhere else

# TrIM
Transient Itterative Memory
This is an extension to the typical Neural Networks by adding a memory layer. This layor is 'quantum' entangled in both the input and output layers simultanously. This gives the AI an internal and self regulated short term memory, part of its own output is part of its next itteration input. This is not long term data/vector memory storage nor recursive input NN's that i've seen elsewhere. This gives the AI some concept of time, more complex and chaotic behaviours (not random), or can even smooth between its state changes organically.
